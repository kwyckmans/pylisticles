# Pylisticles



A flexible CLI application with a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for creating, viewing, and managing various types of lists with custom fields and metadata.

**Personal Project Notice**: This is a personal tool built for my own use as I learn TUI development and create personalized software. While others are free to use it, I do not intend to maintain it for general use, collaborate on features, or provide support.

## Overview

Pylisticles allows you to organize different types of collections - whether it's songs you want to learn on guitar, books you've read, movies to watch, or any other categorized items. Each list type can have its own custom fields and metadata, giving you complete flexibility in how you structure your data.

## Features

- **Flexible Schema**: Each list type can have different fields/columns tailored to its purpose
- **TUI Interface**: Clean, keyboard-driven terminal interface for easy navigation and editing
- **Markdown Storage**: All data is stored in markdown files, making it portable and readable in other applications
- **Multiple Collection Types**: Support for various list types (music practice, reading list, movies, etc.)
- **Custom Metadata**: Add any fields you need for each collection type

## Example Use Cases

- **Music Practice**: Track songs learned/practicing with fields like instrument, difficulty, date practiced, notes
- **Reading List**: Manage books with author, genre, rating, reading status, notes
- **Movie Watchlist**: Organize movies with director, year, genre, watched status, rating
- **Custom Lists**: Create any type of list with the fields that matter to you
