# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the Pylisticles TUI application.

## Taking Screenshots

To capture screenshots:

1. Launch the app: `uv run python main.py`
2. Use your system's screenshot tool to capture:
   - Main collection list view
   - Collection detail view (select a collection to see items)
3. Save screenshots as:
   - `collection-list.png` - Main view showing all collections
   - `collection-details.png` - Detail view showing items in a collection

The app uses the gruvbox theme with blue primary colors and good contrast for keyboard shortcuts.
